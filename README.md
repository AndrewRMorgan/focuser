# Focuser

Focuser is a Chrome Extension that helps you to focus on what you're reading by hiding distracting links and annoying GIF animations at the click of a button.

By hiding links and GIF images you can concentrate on what you're reading, boosting your comprehension and allowing you to enjoy your reading experience. 

Then when you're done, another click brings those links and GIF images straight back.
